        Fried rice is my favourite delicacy in the world. Fried rice is a dish
        of cooked rice that has been stir-fried in a wok or a frying pan and is
        usually mixed with other ingredients such as eggs, vegetables, seafood,
        or meat. It is often eaten by itself or as an accompaniment to another
        dish.

        Spaghetti especailly jollof stir-fry spaghetti is one of my best meals
        ever. I love it because of the mixture of vegetables, chicken, meat and
        other proteins added to it which brings out the flavour and lovely taste
        of spaghetti. It can be eaten alone or as an accompaniment to another
        dish.

        A meat pie is a pie with a chunky filling of meat and often other savory
        ingredients. Meat Pie is moist, yummy and has minced meat, potato and
        carrot filling. The filling is usually adequately seasoned and gives the
        meat pie its unique taste.

      <h3>Procedure</h3>
      <h4>For the meatpie filling:</h4>
      <p><ol>
        <li>
          Peel the Irish potatoes and scrape the carrots, wash and cut these two
          into tiny cubes.
        </li>
        <li>Wash and slice the onions into tiny pieces.</li>
        <li>
          With your cooker or stove set to medium heat, heat the vegetable oil
          in a pot, add the diced onions and stir for a bit, add the minced meat
          and stir vigorously till the minced meat turns pale.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add 1 cup of water and seasonings. Cover the pot and once the contents
          of the pot starts boiling, add the diced carrots and potatoes and cook
          till everything is well done
        </li>
        <li>
          Dissolve 2 tablespoons of plain flour in half cup of cold water and
          add to the meat pie filling. This tip is so that the meat pie filling
          does not dry up during baking. It is also what keeps the meat pie
          filling moist
        </li>
        <li>
          Add salt to taste, stir the contents and turn off the heat. Set the
          meat pie filling aside and start the preparation of the dough.
        </li>
      </ol>
      </p>
      <h4>For the meatpie dough:</h4>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Put the 1 kg of flour in a sizeable bowl; add 2 teaspoons of baking
          powder and 2 pinches of salt. You really do not need a lot of salt for
          the meat pie dough. The meat pie will get most of its taste from the
          filling. Mix these dry ingredients very well.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a tablespoon to scoop the margarine in small bits into the bowl of
          flour. The smaller you make the bits of margarine, the easier it will
          be for you to rub them into the flour.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use finger tips to rub the margarine into the flour till the mix
          becomes like crumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Now, start adding cold water in bits while at the same time folding
          the mix till a stiff ball of dough is formed. You will be surprised at
          how small quantity of water you need to get the dough stiff. At most,
          all you need for the 1 kg of flour is half a cup of water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knead the dough very well, put back in the bowl and leave to rest for
          5 to 7 minutes. This makes the dough more elastic.
        </li>
      </ol></p>
      <h4>Cut, Fill, Fold and Close</h4>
      <p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Set your oven to 170°C (335°F) and leave to preheat while you continue
          with the meat pie.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rub margarine on the insides of the oven tray and set aside. This is
          so that the undersides of the meat pies do not burn or stick to the
          tray during baking.
        </li>
        <li>
          Break the egg, beat it and set aside, you will need it pretty soon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Knead the dough some more, roll it out to achieve a 5mm thickness.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use a cutter, be it the cover of a small pot or a meat pie cutter, to
          make round cuts on the rolled out dough. Remove the excess dough,
          leaving behind the round cuts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Scoop some meat pie filling into the center of the round cuts, the
          quantity should be such that you can comfortably close the dough
          without overflows. Don't worry if you over-filled the first one, you
          have many meat pies to fill today so at some point you will know just
          the right quantity of meat pie filling to scoop into the dough.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rub the egg on the inside edge of the cut meatpie dough. Watch the
          video to see how this is done. This is to ensure that your meat pie is
          perfectly sealed and does not open up while it is being baked.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fold one part of the dough to meet the other end and use a fork to
          press the 2 edges together to close tightly. Place your work of art in
          the oven tray and repeat the previous step till all the cut out dough
          is exhausted.
        </li>
        <li>
          Roll out more dough, cut, fill, close and place in the greased oven
          tray till all the dough is used.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rub the egg on the meat pies. This gives the meat pie a golden brown
          look when done.
        </li>
        <li>
          Set the tray in the preheated oven and bake for 30 to 40 minutes. This
          time will depend on the type and heating capacity of your oven. For
          some ovens, the meat pie will be done in half an hour, for some, it
          may take up to 50 mins. Whatever type of oven you have, the important
          thing to know is that the best meat pies are the ones baked at medium
          heat. You can confirm that the meat pie is done when it starts
          browning.
